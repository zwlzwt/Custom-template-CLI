Node CLI
====================

###  This is a node-cli project for learning purposes. The name is create-template. Because I did not publish the npm package, the way to use it is to clone the project and use the create-template command in the terminal.

### run the script in your local shell
```sh
git clone ...
cd CustomTemple-CLI
npm link
```

### Then can run in any place
```sh
create-template
```
